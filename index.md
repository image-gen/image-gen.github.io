## Pre-requisites

Open to anyone affiliated with MIT, Harvard and Wellesley College. We strongly encourage members of MIT RAISE (Responsible AI for Social Empowerment and Education) to attend this seminar. While this seminar will discuss the current advancements and tools in text-to-image generation, its central focus will be on using these tools to create curriculum for K-12 AI Education. 

## Description

There is currently a proliferation of digital platforms to perform text-to-image generation. These platforms are breaking new ground in AI tools that let anyone, even beginners, easily create images with professional quality appearance. This seminar will explore these text-to-image generation platforms with an emphasis on opportunities in K-12 education. In this seminar, students will review recent technological development that has led to the rapid advancement of text-to-image generation, explore the components of text-to-image generation - including transformers, latent space, and diffusion - and discuss ethical and societal implications of this technology. Final projects will prototype learning activities for a target K-12 age group including learning goals, age appropriate tool introduction, and assessment.
The main goal of the seminar will be to create curriculum using this image generation capability thatâ€™s aligned with our approach of constructionism and computational action. We would also like to stimulate collaborative development between the Personal Robotics Group(PRG) at the MIT Media Lab, App Inventor at MIT CSAIL, and the MIT Scheller Teacher Education Program (STEP) in working towards creating curricula and prototypes.


## Format | Schedule

The seminar will comprise six sessions that will be held remotely via zoom. The schedule is summarized below:
